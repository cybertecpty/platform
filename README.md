# New Nx Repository

<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ✨.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 24** (the version CI runs).
- **pnpm** — this workspace uses pnpm exclusively. Enable it once with `corepack enable`; the
  pinned version comes from `package.json`'s `packageManager` field. `npm` and `yarn` are
  blocked by a `preinstall` guard.

Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

## Pre-commit formatting

`pnpm install` sets up a `husky` `pre-commit` hook that runs `lint-staged` — staged
JS/TS files get `eslint --fix` then `nx format:write`, other supported files get
`nx format:write`, and the changes are re-staged so the commit lands clean. It's a
convenience backstop; CI (`nx format:check`, `nx run-many -t lint`) is the real gate.
Bypass it with `git commit --no-verify`. The hook runs through `sh`, which Git for
Windows installs.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/docs/technologies/typescript/introduction?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `pnpm exec nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your Nx platform setup

🚀 [Finish setting up your workspace](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/1NJ5tXGjpT) to get faster builds with remote caching, distributed task execution, and self-healing CI. [Learn more about Nx Cloud](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud).

## Generate a library

```sh
pnpm exec nx g @nx/js:lib packages/pkg1 --publishable --importPath=@my-org/pkg1
```

## Run tasks

To build the library use:

```sh
pnpm exec nx run pkg1:build
```

To run any task with Nx use:

```sh
pnpm exec nx run <project-name>:<target>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/docs/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/docs/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
pnpm exec nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm exec nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
pnpm exec nx sync:check
```

## Nx Cloud

Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/docs/features/ci-features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Set up CI (non-Github Actions CI)

**Note:** This is only required if your CI provider is not GitHub Actions.

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
pnpm exec nx g ci-workflow
```
